This Annex also provides some examples of private sector support for SG60.\n\nTo recognise the contributions of all Singaporeans and to share the benefits of our nation’s progress, the Government will introduce an SG60 package. Components of the SG60 package are summarised in Table 1, with further details below.\n\nSummary of Measure: One-time SG60 Vouchers for all Singapore Citizen adults aged 21 years and above in 2025. Personal Income Tax Rebate of 60% of tax payable for all tax resident individuals for the Year of Assessment 2025, capped at $200 per taxpayer. An SG60 Baby Gift for all SC babies born in 2025.\n\nAll Singapore Citizens (“SC”) aged 21 and above in 2025 will receive $600 in SG60 Vouchers. SC seniors aged 60 and above in 2025 will receive $200 more – a total of $800 in SG60 Vouchers. The SG60 Vouchers will be disbursed across the month of July. SC seniors will be able to claim the vouchers first, followed by all other SC adults. The SG60 Vouchers will expire on 31 December 2026.\n\nIn terms of claiming and spending, the SG60 Vouchers will have the same user experience as the Community Development Council (“CDC”) Vouchers: The SG60 Vouchers can be claimed digitally on RedeemSG via Singpass. SCs who are unable to claim their vouchers digitally can approach their nearest Community Centres/Clubs for assistance to claim the vouchers. The SG60 Vouchers can be used at all businesses that accept the CDC Vouchers. Half of the SG60 Vouchers will be allocated for spending at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, while the other half will be allocated for spending at participating supermarkets. The SG60 Vouchers will benefit about three million SC adults. More details will be released subsequently by the People’s Association and the CDCs.\n\nThe Government will provide a Personal Income Tax (“PIT”) Rebate of 60% of tax payable for all tax resident individuals for the Year of Assessment (“YA”) 2025 (i.e., for income earned in 2024). The rebate will be capped at $200 per taxpayer. The $200 cap ensures that the PIT Rebate mostly benefits middle-income workers. No application for the PIT Rebate is required. IRAS will compute and grant the rebate automatically to all tax resident individuals. For more information on your PIT Rebate, you may refer to your tax bill for YA 2025. Most taxpayers should receive their tax bills between April to September 2025.\n\nTo celebrate the joy and significance of parenthood, the Government will provide an SG60 Baby Gift for all SC babies born in 2025. More details will be provided at the Prime Minister’s Office’s Committee of Supply.\n\nTo mark the fifth anniversary of the inscription of Hawker Culture onto the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, the Government will provide a one-time SG60 Rental Support to recognise the important role that hawker centres and markets play in our national identity and heritage. The one-time $600 rental support will be extended to each stall in hawker centres and markets managed by Government and Government-appointed operators to appreciate their contributions. Details will be released to stallholders by the relevant agencies.\n\nThe SG Culture Pass aims to foster national pride and identity amongst Singaporeans through local arts and heritage. All SCs aged 18 years old and above in 2025 will be eligible for $100 SG Culture Pass credits. The SG Culture Pass credits will be valid from 1 September 2025 to 31 December 2028. The credits can be used to purchase tickets for eligible local performances, exhibitions, and experiences such as learning tours and participatory workshops, and sold by approved ticketing partners. More details on how to claim the SG Culture Pass credits will be released subsequently by MCCY.\n\nThe SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up aims to encourage broad-based sports participation across different segments of society during SG60. SCs and Permanent Residents will be eligible for a one-off $100 SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up in June 2025. Existing ActiveSG members will receive the $100 SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up. New ActiveSG members will receive $200 credits – $100 credits from the existing new member incentive scheme implemented in 2014 and the $100 SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up. The credits can be used for fees for ActiveSG facilities and to offset fees for ActiveSG programmes. More details will be released at MCCY’s Committee of Supply.\n\nThe Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $600 million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving. The Cultural Matching Fund (“CMF”) aims to encourage broad-based cultural philanthropy through the provision of dollar-for-dollar matching for cash donations to eligible arts and heritage charities. To encourage continued giving to the arts and heritage sector, the Government will provide a $100 million top-up to the CMF and extend it for five years till end-FY 2029.\n\nSince FY 2020, the Government and Tote Board has provided dollar-for-dollar matching support, capped at $250,000 per year per charity for eligible fund-raisers for local charitable causes. To provide our charities continued support, especially during SG60, the Government and Tote Board will provide a $270 million top-up and extend the Enhanced Fund-Raising (“EFR”) Programme for three years until end-FY 2027. Specifically, we will maintain the existing dollar-for-dollar matching support levels in FY 2025, halve the support level in FY 2026, and return to pre-Covid-19 levels in FY 2027. Such an approach will provide charities sufficient time to adjust their fund-raising plans.\n\nCharities can also leverage broad-based support schemes by the Government, such as 250% tax deductions for qualifying donations to Institutions of a Public Character, as well as the Charities Capabilities Fund which provides funding support to enhance the governance and management capabilities of charities.\n\nThe SG Gives matching grant will be introduced to galvanise Singaporeans to contribute to social and community programmes, aligning with the SG60 theme of “Building Our Singapore Together” which rallies Singaporeans to contribute to the next chapter of nation building and commit to building a shared future together. Through the SG Gives matching grant, donations made to eligible social and community programmes through the Community Chest (ComChest), President’s Challenge, and the Collective for a Stronger Society, will be matched by the Government up to $250 million. For every dollar donation made in 2025, it will be matched with an equivalent dollar. To encourage sustained giving, donations of $250,000 or more per year over three years will be matched with $1.50 for every dollar.\n\nThe Government will provide additional grants of $60 million over five years to SHGs to enhance their programming and enable them to better support their communities. The SHGs refer to the Chinese Development Assistance Council, Yayasan MENDAKI, the Singapore Indian Development Association, and the Eurasian Association. Together with the support announced at Budget 2022 and Budget 2023, the SHGs will receive $18 million in FY 2025 and $12 million a year from FY 2026 to FY 2029.\n\nAs of the date of the Budget Statement, the following coffee shop and supermarket operators have committed to providing promotions to celebrate SG60: Badaling Holdings Pte Ltd (at FoodHub locations), Broadway Food Centre (Holdings) Pte Ltd, Chang Cheng Holdings, Koufu Group, NTUC FairPrice Group, Sheng Siong Group Ltd. We encourage all segments of Singapore society to step forward and celebrate SG60 in their own way.\n\nFor more information on the SG60 Personal Income Tax Rebate, SG Culture Pass, SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up, Cultural Matching Fund, Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme, and SG Gives Matching Grant, please visit the respective websites or contact details provided.', 'ANNEX H-2: TAX CHANGES\n\nS/N\n\nName of Tax Change\n\nExisting Tax Treatment\n\nNew Tax Treatment\n\nSupporting Companies and Individuals\n\nN/A\n\n1.

However, deductions are not allowed for designer fees, antiques, fine art, or works carried out to a place of residence provided to employees. Professional fees related to the registration of patents, trademarks, designs, and plant varieties are also tax-deductible. The tax deduction for qualifying IP registration costs has been enhanced to encourage businesses to register and protect their IPs. Businesses can also opt to convert qualifying IP registration costs into cash payouts under the Enterprise Innovation Scheme. Tax deductions for medical expenses incurred for employees are capped at 1% of total employee remuneration, increasing to 2% if certain conditions are met. Rental expenses incurred on premises occupied for business purposes are generally tax-deductible, and contractual retrenchment payments are also tax-deductible regardless of business cessation. Ex-gratia retrenchment payments are deductible only if the business continues. Unutilised Section 14N deductions can be transferred, carried back, or carried forward under certain conditions.', 'urls': ['https://www.iras.gov.sg/schemes/disbursement-schemes/enterprise-innovation-scheme-\\(eis\\)', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_cit_enterprise-innovation-scheme.pdf?sfvrsn=3a36afd3_7', 'https://form.gov.sg/65dfeed0e602e8d2e76e85c1', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/<https:/www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/examples-on-computing-the-medical-expense-capping.pdf?sfvrsn=562b8b17_2>', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/<http:/www.mom.gov.sg/>', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/<https:/www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/tax-treatment-of-business-expenses-\\(g-l\\)#ipp>', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/claiming-reliefs/group-relief', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/claiming-reliefs/loss-carry-back-relief', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/unutilised-items-\\(capital-allowances-trade-losses-donations\\)#title2'], 'pdf': ['Enterprise Innovation Scheme\n\nThis e-Tax Guide explains the Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS) and is relevant to businesses that wish to claim EIS benefits. Businesses engaging in research and development (R&D), innovation, and capability development activities may benefit from enhanced or new tax deductions and/or allowances on qualifying expenditure incurred during the basis periods for Year of Assessment (YA) 2024 to YA 2028. In addition, eligible businesses may opt to convert up to $100,000 of the total qualifying expenditure incurred for each YA into cash at a conversion rate of 20%.\n\nThe EIS was introduced in Budget 2023 to encourage businesses to engage in R&D, innovation, and capability development activities. Under the EIS, existing tax measures are enhanced, and a new tax measure is introduced. Eligible businesses may opt to convert up to $100,000 of the total qualifying expenditure incurred across all the qualifying activities for each YA into cash at a conversion rate of 20%, in lieu of tax deductions/allowances. This e-Tax Guide provides details on the overall features of the EIS.\n\nThe EIS is available from YA 2024 to YA 2028. Under the EIS, enhanced/new tax deductions and/or allowances (collectively referred to as “enhanced deductions”) are granted on qualifying expenditure incurred on the following five qualifying activities: qualifying R&D activities undertaken in Singapore; registration of intellectual property (IPs); acquisition and licensing of IP rights (IPRs); training; and innovation projects carried out with polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), or other qualified partners. Businesses that carry on a trade or business will be able to enjoy enhanced deductions on up to $400,000 of qualifying expenditure incurred for each qualifying activity under paragraphs 4.2(a) to (d), and up to $50,000 of qualifying expenditure incurred for the qualifying activity under paragraph 4.2(e). The qualifying expenditure cap for each qualifying activity is applied on a YA basis and cannot be combined across YAs. The deductions/allowances granted under the EIS are in addition to the base deductions/allowances allowable under prevailing income tax rules. The total deductions/allowances granted are in effect 400% per dollar of qualifying expenditure (up to the applicable cap) for each qualifying activity.\n\nIn lieu of tax deductions/allowances, eligible businesses may also, subject to conditions, opt to convert up to $100,000 of the total qualifying expenditure across all the qualifying activities for each YA into a cash payout at a conversion rate of 20%. Where the qualifying expenditure is subsidised, fully or partially, by a grant or subsidy from the Government, only the amount of expenditure that is net of the grant or subsidy is eligible for an enhanced deduction or a cash payout under the EIS. Enhanced deductions that cannot be fully offset against the income of a business are treated as unutilised trade loss or allowance. Such unutilised trade loss or allowance may be carried forward, transferred to and offset against the income of a related Singapore company under the Group Relief system, or carried back to the immediate preceding YA to be offset against the prior year’s income of the company or the individual.\n\nIn the case of companies, the expenditure cap for each qualifying activity is applicable at the company level. In the case of sole-proprietorships, the expenditure cap for each qualifying activity is applicable at the sole-proprietor level. The same expenditure cap for each qualifying activity is applied regardless of the number of businesses the sole-proprietor is carrying on. In the case of partnerships, the expenditure cap for each qualifying activity is applicable at the partnership level regardless of the number of partners. If a sole-proprietor is also a partner of one or more partnerships, the expenditure cap for each qualifying activity applies for all businesses carried on by him as a sole-proprietor, and a separate expenditure cap for each qualifying activity applies for each partnership business in which he or she is a partner.\n\nIn lieu of tax deductions/allowances, eligible businesses may opt to convert up to $100,000 of the total qualifying expenditure across all the qualifying activities for each YA into cash at a conversion rate of 20%. The cash payout is capped at $20,000 per YA. Each cash payout application is subject to a minimum expenditure of $400. The cash payout option is to help small, growing businesses defray the costs of their innovation activities. The cash payout is not taxable and may be used for any purpose. The cash conversion cap of $100,000 cannot be combined across YAs.\n\nAn eligible business refers to any company, partnership, or sole-proprietorship that carries on business operations in Singapore and has at least three full-time local employees (i.e., Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents with Central Provident Fund contributions) in employment for six months or more in the basis period of the relevant YA. For the purpose of the EIS cash payout, a full-time local employee refers to a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident who earns a gross monthly salary of at least $1,400 and is required under his or her contract of service with an employer to work for at least 35 hours a week. As a general rule, an employee will not be considered a full-time local employee of more than two employers during the same period.\n\nTo receive the cash payout, the eligible business must be carrying on a trade or business and not have ceased business at the time of disbursement of the cash payout. The cash payout option is allowed on a per registration basis, subject to the overall expenditure cap of $100,000 across all five qualifying activities under the EIS for each YA. The registration process for an IPR may take more than one year to complete, depending on the complexity of the IPR, the amendments required to the registration, and the search and examination process. \n\nBusinesses must own the related IPRs registered for a minimum period of one year, failing which claw-back provisions apply. The table summarises the claw-back provision. If the IPR is disposed of within one year, the lower of the sale price of the IPR or deduction granted previously shall be deemed as income in the year of disposal. If the IPR is disposed of after one year, there is no claw-back of enhanced deduction or recovery of cash payout.\n\nFor any enquiries or clarification on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the relevant numbers provided for sole-proprietorships/partnerships and companies.']}",Reimbursement to employees for transport expenses,https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/unutilised-items-\(capital-allowances-trade-losses-donations\)#title2,"The article outlines key tax information regarding reimbursements for transport expenses and related deductions for businesses.
